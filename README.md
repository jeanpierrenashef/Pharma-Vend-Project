> A smart pharmaceutical vending machine that aims to address the unavailability of basic pharmaceuticals and ensure their accessibility in situations where pharmacies are closed or unavailable. By integrating microcontrollers, actuators, and advanced technologies, we automate the dispensing and payment processes to provide convenience and reliability.
>
> Our solution features an interactive robotic system and an AI-trained model for pattern recognition across various areas. Additionally, we offer a user-friendly interface that helps users locate nearby vending machines and enables real-time communication with the system. This approach streamlines access to essential pharmaceuticals and enhances the overall user experience.

### User Stories

#### Customer
- As a Customer, I want to locate nearby vending machines, so I can quickly access essential pharmaceuticals when pharmacies are closed.
- As a Customer, I want to browse available medicines and their details, so I can find and select the medication I need.
- As a Customer, I want the system to guide me to the machine and allow me to shop and dispense medicantions of my choice.

#### Admin 
- As an admin, I want to manage and monitor the stock levels in vending machines, so I can restock them promptly to avoid shortages.
- As an admin, I want to review and analyze sales data, so I can identify trends and improve vending machine performance.
- As an admin, I want the vending machine inventory to be updated in real time and reflected accurately to users, ensuring credibility and trust in the system.

###  PharmaVend is -built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For backend development, the app uses [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), a PHP-based framework known for its scalability and robust API handling capabilities.
- The user and admin panel websites are built using [React](https://react.dev/), a front-end library that delivers a dynamic and interactive interface.
- The IoT integration is powered by the [Arduino Platform](https://www.arduino.cc/), utilizing the [ESP32 microcontroller](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) to control actuators for precise and reliable dispensing of products.
